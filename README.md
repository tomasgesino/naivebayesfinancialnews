# Naive Bayes Financial News Model
Naive Bayes Model that classifies financial news sentiment.

## Suggestion
Remember: *"Never unpickle data that could have come from an untrusted source, or that could have been tampered with"* I would suggest you train your model and use this code for training and saving the model.

## Guide
`csveditor.py`: A script that separates data into Train (70%) and Test (30%).
`sklearnml.py`: A script that tokenizes, vectorizes, trains, and saves the model.
`exceml.py`: A script that tests the model in pandas DataFrame.
